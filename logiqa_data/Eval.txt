On the morning of November 8, the National Bureau of Defense Science, Technology and Industry announced for the first time a partial image of the Chang'e-3 preselected landing zone returned by the Chang'e-2 satellite, the lunar Hongwan area.It is a black-and-white photo with an imaging time of 18?00 on October 28th, which was acquired by satellites about 18.7 kilometers away from the moon.The return of the camera image indicates that the six engineering goals determined by the Chang'e 2 mission have all been achieved, which means that the "Chang'e 2" mission has been a complete success.The main task of the launch of Chang'e-2 is to take high-resolution pictures of the moon's Hongwan area, so as to prepare for the launch of Chang'e-3 satellite and the landing in the future.It is reported that the resolution of the CCD camera carried by Chang'e 2 is much higher than that carried by Chang'e 1.The resolution of Chang'e-2 is better than 10 meters when it runs on a 100-kilometer circular orbit.When it enters an elliptical orbit of 100 kilometers x 15 kilometers, its resolution reaches 1 meter, which has exceeded the original target of 1.5 meters.It is understood that the Chang'e-3 lander will also have a CCD camera in the future.At that time, it will not only take pictures, but also automatically avoid locations where the lander is not suitable for landing during the soft landing process based on the pictures.A flat surface suitable for landing.
Among the following statements, the one that best fits the point of view is
A.It takes about 10 days for the partial image of the Moon Bay area taken by Chang'e 2 to be transmitted to the earth.
